# Learning-Tracker
This is my learning tracking repository, where I will upload all the files and everything, notes, etc from my journey.

I have some very beginner experience, but decided to go more in-depth and learn more and more now, so I decided to create this repository for keeping track of all my notes.

For now, I'm learning Python, so the notes are .ipynb files.

I'm portuguese, so the notes will be half portuguese half english, sorry not sorry!
